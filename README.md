Infineon’s 36 W reference design is a discrete and configurable BLDC LV single-shunt sensorless FOC motor-control ceiling fan solution. The reference board is designed to provide a highly efficient and robust ceiling fan solution with a smooth and fast start-up of the motor to its maximum speed. 
It has a wide operating range from 90 to 300 V AC, and reliable surge protection circuitry with a strong IPA80R1K4CE 800 V MOSFET that can safely protect the system from 4 kV of lightning events. This reference solution uses Infineon’s ICL8810 controller to ensure high power factor (PF), low ATHD, stable outputs, and protections such as overcurrent protection (OCP) and overvoltage protection (OVP) for both input and output are implemented. Secondary-side regulation (SSR) is adopted for highly reliable regulation.
